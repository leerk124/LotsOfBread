                If a shelf-stable item purchase is returned to us new and in original packaging within 15 days of delivery, we will offer a store credit for your order total and less our costs for shipping and handling each way.  However, please be mindful of the following details regarding returns:

                <br>
                <b> Return Policy for Perishable Items </b>
                <br>
                If a perishable item is returned to us marked as “undeliverable” we cannot offer a store credit. Unfortunately, unlike items that have a longer shelf life, items that are perishable are unable to be resold after they are sent back to us. When this situation occurs, we do offer customers a 20% discount on a replacement order.

                <b> Return Policy for Damaged Products </b>
                <br>
                If a product arrives damaged or with items missing, please notify us within 15 days. We would be happy to send you a replacement as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that missing items may have been substituted.
